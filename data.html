    Our primary data source is a website that provides a variety
    of data on Dekalb County, Georgia. The specific section of data that we are focused 
    on is the experiences of commuters in Dekalb County. The website provides a bar graph 
    that displays a breakdown of average commute times from Dekalb County residentsâ€™ homes 
    to their jobs, and how it has changed from 2013 to 2018. Additionally, there is a line graph 
    that tracks how Dekalb county residents have commuted from 2013 to 2018: by motorcycle, public transit, car, 
    bicycle, etc. The site also provides a data visualization that breaks down how many cars are owned by 
    residents of the county. With these various data sets and visualizations, we will be able to gain a 
    better understanding of the experiences of residents in Dekalb county when it comes to commuting to work. 
    After investigating the data, we found certain things interesting and surprising. We were interested 
    in how the commute times had not changed much at all from year to year, and why this was.
    We were also interested in the fact that the numbers stayed steady for every category of how 
    people traveled to work over the course of 5 years, except with the motorcycle and bicycle category. 
    Perhaps this change was seasonal, but it made us wonder why they changed when others stayed steady. 
    A surprising data point to us was the fact that despite seemingly large numbers of people who commute 
    by public transit, less than 5% of people in Dekalb County do not own a car. 
    Of course it is possible that people who own cars do not have enough for 
    every household member to drive to work, but it raised questions.
